Unboxing
^^^^^^^^

i.MX6 SoloX SabreSD comes with a very good and complete documentation.
To verify the content of the box and to move the first steps with the board, visit the
`official documentation page <http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=RDIMX6SABREBRD>`_, in particular
have a look at "**Quick Start Guide for Sabre Board for Smart Devices based on i.MX6 SoloX applications processor**" document.
