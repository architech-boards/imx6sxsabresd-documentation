Meta Layer
==========

A Yocto/OpenEmbedded meta-layer is a directory that contains recipes, configuration files, patches, etc., all needed by
*Bitbake* to properly "see" and build a BSP, a distribution, a (set of) package(s), whatever.
Several meta-layers are provided by Freescale for the SABRE Board.

Please, refer to the software documentation on the `IMXLINUX: Embedded Linux for i.MX Applications Processors <http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=IMXLINUX&fsrch=1>`_
